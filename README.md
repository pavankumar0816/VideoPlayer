## WebVTT (`.vtt`) File Integration

`.vtt` (Web Video Text Tracks) is a file format used to add:

- ðŸ•’ **Chapters** â€” break the video into labeled sections.

- ðŸŽ§ **Captions** â€” include sounds and spoken words.
- ðŸ“„ **Metadata** â€” provide structured text that isn't shown visually.

## Using the `<track>` Tag

The `<track>` tag is used to attach timed text tracks (like subtitles or chapters) to the `<video>` element.

<video controls width="640">
  <source src="your-video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <track
    src="/chapters.vtt"
    kind="chapters"
    label="Chapters"
    default
  />
</video>

## Hosting Media with ImageKit.io

For video and media hosting, ImageKit.io was used. It supports video transformation features like thumbnail extraction, video streaming, and optimization.
